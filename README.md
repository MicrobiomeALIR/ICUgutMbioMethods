Abstract:
The role of the gut microbiome in critical illness is being actively investigated, but the optimal sampling methods for sequencing studies of gut microbiota remain unknown. Stool samples are generally considered gold-standard but are not practical to obtain in the intensive care unit (ICU), and thus, rectal swabs are often used. However, the reliability of rectal swabs for gut microbiome profiling has not been established in this clinical setting. In this study, we compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing results between rectal swab and stool samples collected at three timepoints in mechanically-ventilated critically-ill adults. Rectal swabs comprised 89% of samples collected at the baseline timepoint, but stool samples became more available at later time-points. Significant differences in alpha and beta-diversity between rectal swabs and stool samples were observed (p<0.003), but these differences were primarily due to baseline samples. Higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria phyla (typically skin microbes) was present in rectal swabs compared to stool samples (p<0.02), a difference that was attenuated overtime. The progressive similarity of rectal swabs and stool samples likely results from increasing stool coating of the rectal vault and direct soiling of the rectal swabs taken at later time points. Therefore, inferences about the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness should be drawn cautiously and take into account the actual type and timing of samples analyzed.
